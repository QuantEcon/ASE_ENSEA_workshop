# QuantEcon Summer Course in Quantitative Economics

In July 2022, [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/)  will run an online Summer
Course in Quantitative Economics, in partnership with the [African School of
Economics](https://africanschoolofeconomics.com/) (ASE), and the [Institute of
Statistics and Applied Economics](https://ensea.ed.ci/en/) (ENSEA).  The
target audience for the course is talented young economists from ASE and ENSEA
who aspire to a career in data science or computer-driven economic
modeling.  The course will provide students with an introduction and exposure
to key tools in quantitative economics, which are increasingly in demand in
the rapidly transforming economics job market.

The lead instructor and academic coordinator for the program is [Thomas J.
Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/), Professor of Economics at New York
University and 2011 Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences.

The course is made possible by generous sponsorship from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/).

## Syllabus

The language of instruction will be English.  The programming language used in
the course will be Python.

The course will be run online as a series of 10 three-hour classes.  The
course will cover topics from 

* Foundations of programming in Python
* Data engineering with Pandas
* Linear algebra, principal components and matrix decompositions
* Optimization, filtering, dynamic programming and optimal control
* Search and matching models
* Asset pricing
* Bayesian and frequentist statistics
* Economic and social networks
* Linear programming, optimal transport and mechanism design
* Introduction to auction theory
* Quantitative economic history
* High-performance computing with Python

Background reading on these topics can be found in the following lecture
series:

* [Python Programming for Economics and Finance](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html)
* [Quantitative Economics with Python](https://python.quantecon.org/intro.html)


## Mode of Instruction

Students will require access to a computer.  (Programming tasks will be
assigned but there is no need to install software.) Students will be provided
with materials to help them prepare for classes and solidify understandings of
earlier classes.  

Students will be encouraged to form study groups to foster working in teams (a
valuable skill in both industry and government and academia) We hope that
study groups can include students with mixtures of skills and mathematical and
statistics backgrounds. (This also typically happens in industry and
government and academia.)


## Learning Outcomes

Participants will learn how to connect economic modeling problems to numerical
implementations in Python using clear, efficient and effective code.
Participants will be able to apply basic software engineering principles to
organize, share and collaborate on coding problems.

These skills are in high demand for economists and data scientists at Amazon
and similar organizations around the world.

## Eligibility

The course material will be challenging.  Ideal candidates will already have
had some exposure to probability, linear algebra and principles of economics,
up to the level of a high-quality undergraduate economics or computer science
program.  Programming experience will be helpful but is not a prerequisite.

## Questionnaire

Interested students should complete [the questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lG6kDYzM58pt7lRJpY-1n5ZOn6JA3TYdWs5W_tgNgKY/).

## Registration

Information about how to register for this course will be provided soon.
