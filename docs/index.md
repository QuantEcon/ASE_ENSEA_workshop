# QuantEcon Summer Course in Quantitative Economics

In July 2022, [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/)  will run an online Summer
Course in Quantitative Economics, in partnership with the [African School of
Economics](https://africanschoolofeconomics.com/) (ASE), and the [Institute of
Statistics and Applied Economics](https://ensea.ed.ci/) (ENSEA).  The
target audience for the course is talented young economists from ASE and ENSEA
who want to learn about  data science and computer-driven economic
modeling.  The course will provide students with an introduction and exposure
to key tools in quantitative economics that are in high demand in academic economics and industry.

The workshop will run Monday-Friday July 11-15 and Monday-Friday July 18-22.

The lead instructor and academic coordinator for the program is [Thomas J.
Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/), co-founder of QuantEcon, Professor of Economics at New York
University, and 2011 Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences.

## How will the Workshops Work? 

Due to the large number of enrolments, lectures will be pre-recorded rather than live.  We will also provide assignments and a discourse forum where you can ask questions and get answers from instructors and your peers.  New videos and assignments will be distributed through Google Classroom, starting from July 11th.

The discourse forum will facilitate interaction between participants and with the teaching staff. 

### Google Classroom

You will need to sign up to the Google Classroom using [this invitation link](https://classroom.google.com/c/NDk1NzE1MzU0MDY1?cjc=mwa777q)

This is where we will distribute materials for the workshop. 

We also recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) which is a cloud environment for running notebooks that contain lecture material and python code. All course content can be run locally on your own computer using the Anaconda python distribution, however if you choose to use the Google Colab service you will need to sign up with a Google Account. If your university uses Google Cloud you may use your University login. 

### Discourse Forum

You can now sign up to the [Workshop Discourse Forum](https://quantecon-workshop.discourse.group/login)

This will enable you to access a forum to ask questions and get answers from instructors and peers.

## Syllabus

The language of instruction will be English.  The programming language used in
the course will be Python.

The course will cover selected topics from 

* Foundations of programming in Python
* Data engineering with Pandas
* Linear algebra, principal components and matrix decompositions
* Optimization, filtering, dynamic programming and optimal control
* Search and matching models
* Asset pricing
* Bayesian and frequentist statistics
* Economic and social networks
* Linear programming, optimal transport and mechanism design
* Introduction to auction theory
* Quantitative economic history
* High-performance computing with Python

Background reading on these topics can be found in the following lecture
series:

* [Python Programming for Economics and Finance](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html)
* [Quantitative Economics with Python](https://python.quantecon.org/intro.html)


## Mode of Instruction

Students will require access to a computer.  (Programming tasks will be
assigned but there is no need to install software. There are good free online platforms that provide the Python environments that we'll be using.) Students will be provided
with materials to help them prepare for classes and solidify understandings of
earlier classes.  

Students will be encouraged to form study groups to foster working in teams (a
valuable skill in both industry and government and academia) We hope that
study groups can include students with mixtures of skills and mathematical and
statistics backgrounds. (This also typically happens in industry and
government and academia.)


## Learning Outcomes

Participants will learn how to connect economic modeling problems to numerical
implementations in Python using clear, efficient and effective code.
Participants will be able to apply basic software engineering principles to
organize, share and collaborate on coding problems.

These skills are in high demand for economists and data scientists at leading tech companies and universities around the world.

## Eligibility

The course material will be challenging.  Ideal candidates will already have
had at least some exposure to probability, linear algebra and principles of economics,
up to the level of a good undergraduate economics or computer science
program.  Programming experience will be helpful but is not a prerequisite.

## Questionnaire

Interested students should complete [the questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSca-99V6CXcC6lRcqmC4G1wrw609srg19Df7485K5wOjeesOQ/viewform).
